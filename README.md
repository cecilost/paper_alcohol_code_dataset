Dataset & R Code for: Alcohol consumption, alcohol expectancies, and drinking contexts in young Argentinean college students before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A one-year follow-up study

Description:

The aims of our study are as follow: 1) To assess within-person changes in alcohol consumption in Argentinean college students (aged 18-24), from August 2019 with one-year follow up during the COVID-19 quarantine (lockdown), considering alcohol expectancies, drinking contexts, and main socio-demographic variables. 2) To validate the stability of these predictors’ effects on the alcohol consumption across dependent and independent measures.
